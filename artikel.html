     Your work is what most people might describe as highly unconventional. Do you ever feel the pressure to make things that are more wearable, less crazy?
    </p>
    <p>
     No. [Laughs] I've found that most people don't want to dress me. The first thing I ever made, I was in my first semester at Parsons. We had to spend $100 on a Converse base and re-make something really simple and straightforward. I ended up doing this crazy stuff and made this dress. This girl came up to me and said, "I really like that dress. I want you to design my tour." It was a really crazy email to get.
    </p>
    <img alt="A stylized, colorful photo of two people in elaborate costumes and makeup." class="my-4" height="400" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1aa/image/zmJ5YyvzafVFPi8EEkDVS1lZfeQf5dOCLech0j0viLmpV19fE.jpg" width="600"/>
    <p class="font-bold">
     How much does something like that help a designer?
    </p>
    <p>
     People don't realize to what degree pop stars' image and identity is really created by stylists. As soon as you get on that radar a lot of other stuff starts to happen. I got into magazines, other people started wearing me, things really got rolling after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know this is a question you get asked a lot: you design clothes, but what informs your aesthetic? Where does your particular sense of style come from?
    </p>
    <p>
     Comic books. A lot of comic books. My brother had this really comic book, particularly female-focused comic book run from the '40s. He actually gave me his books to look through and that was a huge part of why my work became so influenced by comics. Also, the fact that my mom was a big proponent of fashion. She was a big part of the '70s, which is sort of obvious if you look at the clothes I make. The comic book and fantasy stuff, which is also a big part of the '70s, has been a huge influence on my work. And then I got into drag. I got into the drag community in New York and that was a huge part of my work. I was really inspired by the queens and how they were able to take something and make it their own. I think that was a huge part of my work.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold">
     Paris is Burning in particular left a big impression on me because it represented the idea that anyone can be a star. It's all about self-creation and shaping your own identity in whatever way you wanted to. I really grabbed onto that idea and ran with it. When one of those kids who came to New York from the Midwest with this vision of what it could be and they just made it happen. It was one of the first times I got to see and be around people who were in the industry. It's all about supporting and just lifting it up and wanting to be a part of their process and their story.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fashion has a weird identity in our culture. It's a very easy thing to parody, but most people have no idea the amount of work involved in being a designer or really understanding how much work or artistry is involved in trying to launch your own line. Fashion itself can say a lot about the culture at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fashion is not really about the subjects. It's really about the subjects and not really about the subjects that people tend to give it credit for. That's the reason why it gets so complicated, especially when you're thinking about context. When I think about that stuff a lot, I do.
